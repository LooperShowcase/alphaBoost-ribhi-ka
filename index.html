    <p>In 2012[17] and 2013 Elon Musk discussed the desire to build a truck with load-compensating suspension, making comparisons with a Ford F-250.[18][19] In early 2014 Musk predicted 4â€“5 years before work could start on the product.[20]

        In mid-2016, Musk outlined the intent for a new kind of consumer pickup truck,[21] and suggested using the same chassis for a van and a pickup truck.[22] In late 2017, the size was estimated to be at least that of a Ford F-150, in order to be large enough to enable a "game-changing" feature.[23] During the Tesla Semi and Tesla Roadster unveiling in November 2017, a picture of a "pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck" was displayed.[24] Background ideas had been in preparation for nearly five years.[25]
        
        In late 2018, Musk anticipated a prototype to be ready to show in 2019.[26]</p>
